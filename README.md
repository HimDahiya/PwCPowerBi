The PwC Power BI Job Simulation consists of three tasks, progressing from easy to medium difficulty. 
These tasks involve kind of heavy transformations to prepare the data for easy and flexible visualization. 

Additionally, the program provides professional samples created by PwC Business Intelligence developers, allowing me to compare and benchmark my work.

If you're interested, the PwC simulation includes:
- Call Center Performance Dashboard: Analyzing customer and agent behavior.
- Retention and Churn Risk Analysis.
- Diversity and Inclusion Analysis.
  
Task 1: Call Centre Trends
- Possible KPIs include:
Overall customer satisfaction Overall calls answered/abandoned Calls by time Average speed of answer Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Task 2: Customer Retention
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion 
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.
