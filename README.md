The PwC Power BI Job Simulation consists of three tasks, progressing from easy to medium difficulty. 
These tasks involve kind of heavy transformations to prepare the data for easy and flexible visualization. 

Additionally, the program provides professional samples created by PwC Business Intelligence developers, allowing me to compare and benchmark my work.

If you're interested, the PwC simulation includes:
- Call Center Performance Dashboard: Analyzing customer and agent behavior.
